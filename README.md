Got it ✅  
So now you’re asking for a clean **GitHub-ready README.md** for your **Blog List Project** (another learning portal project, like the Match Game one).  

Here’s a professional, neat **README.md** that you can upload to your repo:  

***

# 📝 Blog List (React Project)  

This is a **ReactJS practice project** where I built a **Blog List application**. The app displays user profile information and a list of blogs on the **Home route**, while also including `About` and `Contact` routes to practice **routing** concepts.  

***

## 📌 Project Description  

- The **Home Route (`/`)** displays user profile info and a list of blogs.  
- The **blogs list** is rendered from a provided `blogsList` array that includes:  
  - `id` (unique identifier)  
  - `title` (blog heading)  
  - `description` (short blog content)  
  - `publishedDate` (blog post date)  
- Users can also navigate to:  
  - **About route → `/about`**  
  - **Contact route → `/contact`**  

***

## 🚀 Features  

- 🧑 Displays **user info component** with profile picture and name.  
- 📚 Renders a **list of blogs dynamically**.  
- 🌐 Implements **routing in React** (`/`, `/about`, `/contact`).  
- 🎨 Styled layout with **responsive design**.  
- 📝 Clean component structure for easier scalability.  

***

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **ReactJS** (Functional Components)  
- **React Router** for handling routes  
- **CSS3** for styling

## 🎯 What I Learned  

- Setting up **React Router** for multiple routes.  
- Building reusable React components (`UserInfo`, `BlogList`, `BlogItem`).  
- Passing data as **props** into components.  
- Styling React apps with a **mobile-first responsive approach**.

👉 Do you also want me to prepare a **combined portfolio-style README** where you list **both Match Game + Blog List projects together** (so your GitHub will look more like a portfolio collection)?
